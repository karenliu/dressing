  \label{table:actionQueue}
\end{table}


We have designed a system that allows a virtual human character to put on various types of garments. Our system consists of three main components: primitive action editor, dressing control and cloth simulation. We have designed a small set of \emph{primitive actions} to describe a dressing sequence. For example, putting an arm into a sleeve can be described as first emph{aligning} the hand with the armhole and then \emph{dragging} the cloth from the wrist to the shoulder. Given a piece of garment, a character and a reference dressing motion, our system allows a user to use the action editor to decompose the entire
dressing sequence into a queue of these high level actions. Table~\ref{table:actionQueue} shows a complete action queue for putting on a jacket.
At each step, our system fetches an action from the action queue, executes its corresponding dressing controllers and simulates the physics of the cloth. Figure \ref{fig:overview} illustrates the main components of our system.
