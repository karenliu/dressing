  \label{table:actionQueue}

We have designed a system that allows a virtual human character to put on
various types of garments. Our system consists of three main components:
the primitive action editor, the dressing controller and the cloth
simulator. The input to our system includes a garment, a character, and a
reference dressing motion that approximates the desired dressing style.
The reference motion can be a motion captured sequence or a sparse set of
keyframes. The user first assembles a sequence of actions to describe the
reference motion using our primitive action editor. For example, putting
an arm into a sleeve can be described as first \emph{aligning} the hand
with the armhole and then \emph{dragging} the cloth up the arm, from the
wrist to the shoulder. These primitive actions are parameterized
building blocks for creating various dressing animations.
Table~\ref{table:actionQueue} shows a complete action queue for putting on
a jacket. At each step, our system fetches an action from the
queue, executes the corresponding dressing controller and simulates the
physics of the cloth. Figure \ref{fig:overview} illustrates the main
components of our system.
